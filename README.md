## Objective:

To build a program that is able to count each word in a .txt file and bring back the amount of times each word appears in order.

In this file contains a text document and Java code that will access the lyrics on the text file. By using a hashmap data structure we will be able to easily access and assign each KEY WORD a VALUE which will also allow us to increment/decrement.

There is also an HTML language based website that compiles the most appeared words in a heart form, with the cover art as the background.
